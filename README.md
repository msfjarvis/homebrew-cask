# msfjarvis Cask

Homebrew formulae for some tools that I use and can't find on Linuxbrew or don't like the structure of. I hope this repository stays sparse.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install msfjarvis/cask/<formula>`

Or `brew tap msfjarvis/cask` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msfjarvis/homebrew-cask/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
